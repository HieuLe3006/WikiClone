# Wiki-Clone

## Description
This is a sort of my DYI take on Wiki-Clone. Similar to the official Wiki webpage, Wiki-Clone includes some of Wiki's most basic functionalities: 
- An Entry Page
- An Index Page
- Ability to create a new entry
- Ability to edit an entry
- Ability to direct users to a random entry

All entries are stored locally. 
## Method of implementation
Wiki-Clone is implemented on `Django` framework with some of the necessary CSS to create a somewhat lookalike clone of the original Wiki page.
To run the Django app, use command:

```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
